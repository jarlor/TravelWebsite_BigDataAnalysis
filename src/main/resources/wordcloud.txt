Click and collect is a shopping system where a consumer purchases groceries online using a retailer website or mobile app and then picks them up at the store. While still in its infant stages in the United States, click and collect has already proven popular in Europe, with French and English retailers leading the way.  In the United States, Harris Teeter stands out as a firm that has successfully implemented click and collect, their take on it being called “Express Lane”.</p><br/><p>Using DataRank’s sentiment analysis tools, we are able to take a look at customer comments related to the Express Lane program and compare those thoughts to the business as a whole. The results are promising for Harris Teeter. As displayed by the graphics below, Teeter’s Express Lane positive sentiment enjoyed a significant advantage over the store as a whole with consumers touting its convenience and ease of use.</p><br/><p>Teeter’s click and collect success has not gone unnoticed in the grocery world. Mike Schlotman, Kroger’s chief financial officer, has mentioned the program as a contributing factor to their purchase of the upscale, southeastern and mid-Atlantic grocery chain. When or if Kroger might implement a similar program is still unclear; however, the possible implementation of a click and collect program by the nation’s second largest grocery could push other to accelerate the pace of their own click and collect programs. With the advent of online shopping and click and collect, the days of scouring aisles for groceries could soon be over, replaced by a quick click on a smartphone or laptop.</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/2d43a6aa6a37f4762725999fba3230ee/tumblr_inline_mvfvo5PsHz1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/5d8c421179de78f0812a9e494da2748d/tumblr_inline_mvfvp7QoTx1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><br/></blockquote><br/><p></p><br/><br/><p></p>Harris Teeter click and collect kroger express lane grocery store waiting in line

While many pursue their resolution with a <a href="http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Gym_Memberships_Up_30_This_Time_of_Year_136242903.html" target="_blank">new gym membership</a> others are looking instead to high-tech solutions to get in shape. Two of the most popular are the Fitbit Flex and the Jawbone UP. These devices are strapped to the user’s wrist and are intended to measure activity throughout the day as well as quality of sleep at night. Users then view their performance by syncing the device with their smart phones. With reviews comparing the two products <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fitbit-flex-vs-jawbone-up-a-comparative-review/" target="_blank">having</a> <a href="http://bgr.com/2013/08/15/jawbone-up-vs-fitbit-flex-review/" target="_blank">mixed</a> <a href="http://cnettv.cnet.com/8301-13484_53-57591554-10391694/prizefight-fitbit-flex-vs-jawbone-up/" target="_blank">results</a> the DataRank team decided to see which product will help you quantify your resolution progress.</p><br/><p>Comments about these products were analyzed for overall sentiment  in 4 sub-categories: price, reliability, associated smart phone app, and comparison to competitor. The Sentiment shown below represents the percent of online comments expressing either a positive, neutral, or negative opinion of the product within a subcategory.</p><br/><blockquote><br/><p><strong>Sentiment for Fitbit Flex and Jawbone Up</strong></p><br/></blockquote><br/><p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/f1d1dc88bfd8afc3e04f116bc202b2af/tumblr_inline_mz7n5bcFOz1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><br/><p>The Fitbit Flex evokes a much stronger reaction from consumers, having more decidedly positive and negative conversation than the more neutral conversation around the Jawbone Up. The higher positive sentiment in the price category for the Flex is unsurprising given lower price tag. Investigation into the higher percent of negative price comments around the Flex’s revealed a significant number of consumers frustrated with online retailers who were charging more than the recommended price for the product.</p><br/><p>Reliability was a weak point for both of these products with consumers lodging the most complaints of any category. The Jawbone Up suffers particularly heavily in this category with 39% of all reliability posts mentioning a need to return or replace the product. Only 10% of Fitbit Flex reliability comments mentioned problems so extreme. The UP shows advantages in its smart phone app over the Flex , slightly outpacing the Flex in this category.</p><br/><p>The most telling category, however, is the sentiment when a consumer compared the two products in a single comment. Consumers discussing both the Fitbit Flex and the Jawbone UP were far more generous toward the Flex than toward the Jawbone UP and tended to pick it.</p><br/><p>While online conversation indicates consumer preference for the Fitbit Flex, neither product shows a particularly stand-out performance. Improvements may be necessary for both products before too many of us rely on either brand to help us get ready for beach season. Both companies are working on new products that will hopefully alleviate the reliability concerns.</p>New Years new years resolution exercise jawbone up fitbit flex product review datarank

<p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/af16f1c543c3e53cca4a06b3b968c42e/tumblr_inline_mz7l3kgUoy1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><br/><p>President Obama’s health reform bill, commonly referred to as Obamacare, has been mired in technical problems and at the center of fierce political fights since its troubled launch. While the law has long divided the American electorate, vitriol surrounding it may have hit all time highs in October, November, and December. Glitches forced a complete revamping of the main access point for consumers to buy insurance on the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, while millions of Americans waited in queues and questioned whether their information had actually been processed.  Still more would take to the Internet to express their political opinions regarding the law. </p><br/><p>In supermarkets, long wait times often lead to consumers complaining smartphone in hand, about bad service, the magazine selection and anything else that may have gone wrong that trip—with something as delicate as healthcare DataRank wondered if browsing consumers might turn to social media to share their experiences. Fortunately for our analysis, and less so for Mr. Obama, they did.</p><br/><p>Beginning with the program’s October 1<sup>st</sup> launch, consumers noticed delays, bugs, and crashes-these problems have persisted, to a lesser degree after early December-appearing in just more than 10% of comments over the three month period with the greatest concentration of these comments coming in October.  Price was another area of contention appearing in nearly 9% of comments. These comments tended to blame the law for increases in costs or feature discussion related to the hundreds of thousands of plans which were slated to be canceled due to non-compliance with the law’s standards.</p><br/><p>While just under one in four comments were related to some aspect of the website or the law’s impact on a health insurance policy, the remaining three quarters of comments represented a digital political arena as millions of Americans praised or scorned the changes to the healthcare system.</p><br/><p>In the three-month period since the healthcare exchange’s debut, Obamacare has seen a decline in positive sentiment, as measured by DataRank and traditional polling. Negativity reached its height in mid-November as bad experiences and comments by the laws detractors increased in volume while supporters found difficulties troublesome to defend, resulting in a corresponding decrease in positive comment volume and sentiment.</p><br/><p align="center"><strong>DataRank Sentiment and Polling Approval for the Affordable Care Act</strong></p><br/><p align="center"><strong><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/bb933029f9e33577b9859205cacaea88/tumblr_inline_mz7l5sDarX1qkd7v4.png"/></strong></p><br/><br/><p>As politicians look to the 2014 mid-term elections, many Democrats, particularly in republican leaning states, are finding Obamacare to be a heavy weight around their necks. In Arkansas for example, Mr. Obama’s health reform is seen through a substantially more negative lens than it is for the nation as a whole. This fact poses challenge for Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor, as well as for gubernatorial candidate Mike Ross.  Due to Mr. Pryor’s vote for the bill in the Senate, he has suffered from association more than Mr. Ross, who voted against the final product in the House of Representatives. Mr. Pryor has been 2.4 times more likely to be mentioned alongside Obamacare in social media, and as DataRank sentiment data and polls show few of his constituents approved of his decision. Mr. Ross has so far escaped much of this criticism, but will likely not be free from it as the campaign for Governor progresses.</p><br/><p align="center"><strong>DataRank Sentiment (Arkansas) and Polling Approval (National Polling) for the Affordable Care Act</strong></p><br/><p align="center"><strong><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/baaefabb83225d8ee563591d9680451d/tumblr_inline_mz7l7tOaQ91qkd7v4.png"/></strong></p><br/><br/><p> </p>obamacare affordable care act politics datarank arkansas mark pryor mike ross polls

<p>DataRank has developed an analytics tool that can organize and analyze online conversations about a brand or competitor. It can prioritize data using the revolutionary Quality Score algorithm. Clients can use DataRank to locate actionable data beginning with the first comment instead of going over the comments and sorting through pages.</p><br/><p>DataRank users can monitor different topics in the DataRank dashboard. It can pull in all discussions and comments from all around the World Wide Web and put them in one spot. Using its own proprietary algorithm, all incoming information are “DataRanked” to sort out hot conversations from those that are not.</p><br/><p>All topics are ranked according to characteristics. DataRank uses the following criteria:</p><br/><p>1. The commenter’s influence based of his social media profile;</p><br/><p>2. The comment’s influence based on how it was interacted or shared;</p><br/><p>3. The quantity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics">demographic metadata</a>;</p><br/><p>4. The relevance of searches made within the topic;</p><br/><p>5. The recency of the topic.</p>DataRank

Opposing these initiatives are scientists and food companies who believe GMO’s to be perfectly safe and a necessary aspect of modern food production. Companies are concerned that labeling products as “GMOs” will make them appear unsafe to consumers, although almost all evidence to date has been to the contrary. </p><br/><p>Unfortunately for major food companies, interest in GMO labeling has grown steadily over the last few years, spiking with voting initiatives such as California’s Prop 37 and Washington’s I-522.</p><br/><p><strong>GMO Labeling Search Interest 2011-Present</strong></p><br/><p> <img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/8ca1652fe2547d85e4e98c6ddd0957ce/tumblr_inline_mwxv6gji7P1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><br/><p>Geographically, interest remains concentrated in a few areas, primarily states with large metropolitan areas and so-called “policy innovators” such as California, Washington, and Connecticut.</p><br/><p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/a218e405b3de4cc1fac9c98fb3f52806/tumblr_inline_mwxv9jCkWL1qkd7v4.png"/> </p><br/><p>Using DataRank’s social listening technology, we were able to take a look at sentiment and share of voice for brands containing GMOs. For consumer-facing companies, the GMO labeling debate has moved from the abstract to the actual.  The conversation has changed from GMO crops in the field and in the supply chain to in-aisle consumer concern that branded products <em>containing GMOs</em> could be harmful. Here are a couple examples of brands affected by the GMO labeling push:</p><br/><p><strong>GMO Discussion is Beginning to Impact Real Products</strong></p><br/><p><strong><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/4bd260608e3b783ba9f053c4c9679040/tumblr_inline_mwxvu0a4Vi1qkd7v4.png"/></strong></p><br/><p>The numbers appear to show that while those who are against GMO’s only make up a small percentage of a given product’s consumers, they are vocal and extremely negative towards it. In the past, vocal advocates have often been successful in gaining broader support for their efforts. A recent example would be the outcry against trans fats. Trans fat went from being a non-issue at the beginning of the 2000’s to a possible nationwide ban in 2013. Unfortunately for food manufacturers, interest in GMO labeling appears to be even higher according to this Google searches:</p><br/><p><strong>Comparison of trans fat searches to GMO labeling searches:</strong></p><br/><p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/d88ef0a95179ebac4c385fe1feb6dab4/tumblr_inline_mwyi6ulEmt1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><br/><p></p><br/><p>Large food manufacturers will need to be out in front of legislative efforts to understand the debate and limit their exposure to consumer concerns on safety by either changing offerings or engaging in consumer education. Fortunately for them, unlike trans fats GMO products have not been proven dangerous. This debate will likely be a long and prolonged one.  </p>gmo ban non-gmo gmo labeling orville redenbacher jif peanut butter chef boyardee transfat

However, an aging population and a heightened preference for convenience, in combination with increasingly low-cost shipping, may be pushing retiring boomers to reexamine the likes of Amazon and Walmart.com for bulkier purchases. </p><br/><p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/4931d23836722d03fea67037919c120f/tumblr_inline_mz7lnj5vaA1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><br/><p>By 2030, according to census estimates, nearly one in five Americans will be over the age of 65, but these retirees will likely live very different post-work lives from previous generations.  More immersed in technology than their parents and with fewer children to provide support, Baby Boomers will look for technological solutions to help them enjoy their golden years. This may even include avoiding physical store locations all together for difficult to carry purchases-opting instead to let a delivery service do the heavy lifting.</p><br/><p> <img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/3609037375a4c0aa759718f94a414c61/tumblr_inline_mz7lnujCvt1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><br/><p>Online merchants like Amazon and Walmart appear best positioned to begin winning over these valuable consumers by already offering robust online stores with free shipping, large numbers of reviews, and programs like Amazon Prime that are designed to improve the consumer experience. This transition may weigh mostly heavily on club retailers as online merchants improve overall bulk offerings and target America’s largest and wealthiest demographic group. </p>aging amazon walmart sams club costco retail datarank free shipping

This has been in keeping with a more aggressive expansion strategy that the grocer has begun to pursue; however, the usually picky acquisition team at Kroger may face obstacles as it eyes weaker brands in markets where Kroger is not as strong and other players are plentiful and strong.</p><br/><p>Acquisitions may represent an easier path to entering new markets for Kroger and in a low-interest rate environment purchases are more appealing. Analysts note that Kroger is one of the strongest firms in its market and has “virtual first-refusal rights on any store or chain up for sale.”  Despite this, analysts tend to believe that Kroger will remain committed to a strategy of smaller buys to enter new markets while investing heavily in existing stores.  Kroger continues to have no presence in the upper Midwest and the Northeast and is still a minor presence in many markets.</p><br/><p>By pursuing this strategy Kroger will need to feel its way through a competitive landscape of both strong firms and laggards. DataRank examine has looked to understand this layout using its social listening technology to find which stores present a wall that Kroger may struggle to penetrate and which may be on the way out in this next wave of consolidation and grocery-turf-wars.</p><br/><p>Sentiment is high for retailers like Publix and Wegmans, potentially valuable pickups however highly unlikely to sell or worse yet for Kroger formidable opponents capable of holding out the grocery giant. Analysts project this leaves  more probable but also more problematic options including Albertsons and Jewel Osco. Jewel Osco could serve as a door to Chicago and Albertsons could dramatically grow Kroger&#8217;s footprint. Both grocers have been rumored to be possible targets but with high negative sentiment associated with their brands Kroger may be reticent to import problem children into a prosperous and growing family.</p><br/><p align="center"><strong>Retailer Sentiment and Territory</strong></p><br/><p align="center"><strong><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/9ede330f20257e47c01f8b0c8e19f341/tumblr_inline_mvfvth6H7z1qkd7v4.png"/></strong></p>albertsons aldi brookshire food lion Giant Eagle Harris Teeter HEB jewel osco kroger meijer publix safeway stop & shop Walmart wegmans mergers and acquisitions grocery store business whales

The once small strain, formerly just under 1% of all yogurt sales in the US, has surged to represent over one in three sales of yogurt&#8212;and the trend shows no sign of stopping.</p><br/><br/><p><strong>Search Results Show a Rapid Increase in Interest and Discovery</strong></p><br/><p><strong><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/28adb6db057ccfe93abf0b9c50a783f0/tumblr_inline_mwxw8rQKOs1qkd7v4.png"/></strong></p><br/><br/><p>DataRank aggregated online conversation around three of the top brands within greek yogurt and analyzed the consumer sentiment.  Green represents positive sentiment (number of comments where a consumer expresses a positive opinion about a brand) and red represents negative sentiment (number of comments where a consumer expresses a negative opinion about a brand).</p><br/><p><strong>Sentiment and Share of Voice</strong></p><br/><p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/ffdbe1f33b42eed998d00d0e0720cfbd/tumblr_inline_mwxw69JaXh1qkd7v4.png"/></p><br/><br/><p><em>*Sentiment and Share of Voice (% of comments mentioning a trait/brand) calculated by DataRank</em></p><br/><p>Oikos and Chobani hold significant leads in sentiment and conversation volume over Yoplait. Looking at consumer feedback it appeared as though customers were unhappy with the thickening agent Yoplait uses in lieu of the traditional straining method for preparing greek yogurt. Consumer sentiment appears to have forced Yoplait to change course and the yogurt giant plans to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323689204578569843823116744" target="_blank">alter</a> its formula in the near future.</p><br/><p>Unsurprisingly current market leader Chobani has a much larger share of the conversation around it than other brands, generating nearly four in five brand based greek yogurt comments. However, while both Oikos and Chobani have a high sentiment, Oikos is ahead in most categories-likely a result of a recent Chobani recall and aggressive advertising by Dannon, the brands parent. Oikos comments show consumers are responding positively to the John Stamos ad campaign, with several tweets mentioning “waiting for John Stamos to appear”.  Chobani comments reveal measurable consumer concern about the recent <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579056861336768506" target="_blank">recall</a> on a small number of their yogurts. Oikos’s high brand sentiment mixed with consumer concern over the Chobani’s recall poises Dannon to gain some additional market share.</p><br/><p>With consumer interest still growing and an overall high sentiment it’s no surprise that in a <a href="http://www.affinnova.com/greekyogurt/" target="_blank">recent study</a> by the marketing firm Affinnova found that consumers would be interested in new products that contain greek yogurt. So be on the lookout for Oikos and Chobani branding on everything from salad dressing, to beauty cream to sanitary wipes.</p>oikos dannon john stamos yoplait greek yogurt chobani
